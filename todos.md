### XTerm
On Ubuntu, change the default terrminal emulator with:
sudo update-alternatives  --config x-terminal-emulator

This has to be done after xterm was installed and is maybe difficult to do automatically, because a context menu opens that provides to select it by a number.
Maybe that is not the same menu on all OS's or the same number???!
