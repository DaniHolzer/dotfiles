# Alfred Documentation
After you finished installing Alfred, you have to go to the Mac system settings
again, to put Alfred in the Developer Tools.  
This entry exists only if you have installed Apples Xcode on your machine.  
System Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Tools > Add Alfred by the + symbol

If you'd like to see my commands, click [here](alfred/docs/documentation.md)

<br>

## Settings
Add in Features > Default Results the /Applications directory
In Advanced, set the location for the Alfred settings to be saved.
I do not use iCloud or GitHub, because there can be transmitted things like API
keys etc. My directory for Alfred is `~/.config/alfred`. I've backup this on a
private disk.
